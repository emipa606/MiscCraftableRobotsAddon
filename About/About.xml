[h1] DISCLAIMER [/h1]
[code]I'm not a professional modder, so please report any bugs you find and I'll try my best to fix it![/code]

Currently taking a break from Rimworld modding, so not updating this mod for now.

[h1] What does it do?[/h1]
This mod tweaks a few things on the main mod:

[b]Gardener Bot[/b]
- Will now do cooking jobs as well
- Workspeed increased
- Added Cooking skill, set to 20, so it can cook things that require it

[b]Crafting Bot[/b]
- Will now do art jobs as well
- Workspeed increased
- Added Intellectual skill, set to 20, so it can craft things that require it

[b]Hauler Bot[/b]
- Carry capacity increased (Can now haul a lot more per trip)
- Move speed increased (5x increase from base mod for optimal hauling)

[b]Mining Bot, Cleaner Bot and Construction Bot[/b]
- Workspeed increased
- Move speed increased
- Construction Bot will haul more stuff at once to blueprints

It also adds new bot types (All bots have level 20 skills, just as in the parent mod):
[b]ER Bot:[/b]
- A robot capable of tending wounds, doing surgeries and fighting fires.
[b]BONUS[/b]
If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787359789]Questionable Ethics Enhanced[/url] is loaded, ER Bot will do Vat Maintaining jobs

[b]Analysis Bot:[/b]
- A robot capable of doing research type jobs, such as research itself and operating scanners
[b]BONUS[/b]
If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1505914869]What the hack?![/url] is loaded, Analysis Bot will do Hacking jobs
If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2056230561]Preemptive Strike (v1.1 Fork)[/url] is loaded, Analysis Bot will do Recon jobs

[h1] Robots for a few mods [/h1]
An Atomic Bot has been added for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127530465]Rimatomics[/url], for Nuclear jobs
A Fisher Bot has been added for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1914064942]Vanila Fishing Expanded[/url], for Fishing jobs
A Beekeeper Bot has been added for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1558161673]RimBees[/url], for Beekeeping jobs

[b]These robots will only appear in your game if you have the linked mod activated on your modlist. Otherwise they won't appear anywhere.[/b]

All robots follow the same recipes as the main mod (150 Steel, 30 Plasteel, 100 Gold and 5 Components)

The textures used for the new bots on this mod are just recolorings of the original mod's bots, with a few tweaks

[h1] Better textures [/h1]
I'm no artist. If you want something more visually appealing, I highly recommend using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2140349611]Misc. Craftable Robots Retexture[/url] by gloriousyuri

[h1] Compatibility [/h1]
[b]QualitySurgeon[/b] - ERBots will not do surgery with this mod activated

[h1] Dependencies and load order [/h1]
