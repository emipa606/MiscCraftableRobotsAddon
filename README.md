[code]I'm not a professional modder, so please report any bugs you find and I'll try my best to fix it![/code]

Currently taking a break from Rimworld modding, so not updating this mod for now.

#  What does it do?

This mod tweaks a few things on the main mod:

**Gardener Bot**
- Will now do cooking jobs as well
- Workspeed increased
- Added Cooking skill, set to 20, so it can cook things that require it

**Crafting Bot**
- Will now do art jobs as well
- Workspeed increased
- Added Intellectual skill, set to 20, so it can craft things that require it

**Hauler Bot**
- Carry capacity increased (Can now haul a lot more per trip)
- Move speed increased (5x increase from base mod for optimal hauling)

**Mining Bot, Cleaner Bot and Construction Bot**
- Workspeed increased
- Move speed increased
- Construction Bot will haul more stuff at once to blueprints

It also adds new bot types (All bots have level 20 skills, just as in the parent mod):
**ER Bot:**
- A robot capable of tending wounds, doing surgeries and fighting fires.
**BONUS**
If https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787359789]Questionable Ethics Enhanced is loaded, ER Bot will do Vat Maintaining jobs

**Analysis Bot:**
- A robot capable of doing research type jobs, such as research itself and operating scanners

#  Robots for a few mods 

An Atomic Bot has been added for https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127530465]Rimatomics, for Nuclear jobs
A Fisher Bot has been added for https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1914064942]Vanila Fishing Expanded, for Fishing jobs
A Beekeeper Bot has been added for https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1558161673]RimBees, for Beekeeping jobs

**These robots will only appear in your game if you have the linked mod activated on your modlist. Otherwise they won't appear anywhere.**

All robots follow the same recipes as the main mod (150 Steel, 30 Plasteel, 100 Gold and 5 Components)

The textures used for the new bots on this mod are just recolorings of the original mod's bots, with a few tweaks

#  Better textures 

I'm no artist. If you want something more visually appealing, I highly recommend using https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2140349611]Misc. Craftable Robots Retexture by gloriousyuri

#  Compatibility 

**QualitySurgeon** - ERBots will not do surgery with this mod activated

#  Dependencies and load order 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=724602224]Misc Robots and https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1409512356]Misc Craftable Robots. Load after both of them
