#  DISCLAIMER 

[code]I'm not a professional modder, so please report any bugs you find and I'll try my best to fix it![/code]

Currently taking a break from Rimworld modding, so not updating this mod for now.

#  What does it do?

This mod tweaks a few things on the main mod:

**Gardener Bot**
- Will now do cooking jobs as well
- Workspeed increased
- Added Cooking skill, set to 20, so it can cook things that require it

**Crafting Bot**
- Will now do art jobs as well
- Workspeed increased
- Added Intellectual skill, set to 20, so it can craft things that require it

**Hauler Bot**
- Carry capacity increased (Can now haul a lot more per trip)
- Move speed increased (5x increase from base mod for optimal hauling)

**Mining Bot, Cleaner Bot and Construction Bot**
- Workspeed increased
- Move speed increased
- Construction Bot will haul more stuff at once to blueprints

It also adds new bot types (All bots have level 20 skills, just as in the parent mod):
**ER Bot:**
- A robot capable of tending wounds, doing surgeries and fighting fires.
**BONUS**
If [Questionable Ethics Enhanced](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787359789) is loaded, ER Bot will do Vat Maintaining jobs

**Analysis Bot:**
- A robot capable of doing research type jobs, such as research itself and operating scanners
**BONUS**
If [What the hack?!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1505914869) is loaded, Analysis Bot will do Hacking jobs
If [Preemptive Strike (v1.1 Fork)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2056230561) is loaded, Analysis Bot will do Recon jobs

#  Robots for a few mods 

An Atomic Bot has been added for [Rimatomics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127530465), for Nuclear jobs
A Fisher Bot has been added for [Vanila Fishing Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1914064942), for Fishing jobs
A Beekeeper Bot has been added for [RimBees](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1558161673), for Beekeeping jobs

**These robots will only appear in your game if you have the linked mod activated on your modlist. Otherwise they won't appear anywhere.**

All robots follow the same recipes as the main mod (150 Steel, 30 Plasteel, 100 Gold and 5 Components)

The textures used for the new bots on this mod are just recolorings of the original mod's bots, with a few tweaks

#  Better textures 

I'm no artist. If you want something more visually appealing, I highly recommend using [Misc. Craftable Robots Retexture](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2140349611) by gloriousyuri

#  Compatibility 

**QualitySurgeon** - ERBots will not do surgery with this mod activated

#  Dependencies and load order 

[Misc Robots](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=724602224) and [Misc Craftable Robots](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1409512356). Load after both of them
